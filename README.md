# Stock-Analysis

#Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this challenge is to take the module 2 code, refactor it, in order to produce a new code that will run the data quicker. Essentially, we are learning that a refactored code allows for a more efficient run. 
##Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2018 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script. Pictures are included in the resource folder attached. As far as the original vs. the refactored, the refactored, in 2017 and 2018, both ran quicker. The refactored was more efficient. 
###Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
#What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? Apart from simply having a quicker and more efficient code, a refactored code can allow for better functionality within larger datasets. This could potentially save time. Along with that, it reduces complexity for easier understanding. It's easier to maintain as well. The disadvantages I had included consistent errors, feeling super lost, and wondering what in the world I was doing. However, it was worth it in the end because I got a good understanding of the purpose behind it all.
##How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
I gained a better understanding of why it is important to refactor to allow for more accessibility, less complexity, quicker functionality, and a more efficient experience.
